# true-connect — user-profile CRUD

This document contains a complete, ready-to-run FastAPI project codebase named `true-connect` for profile CRUD operations. It includes: Dockerfile, docker-compose, `uv`-friendly pyproject, pytest tests, Pydantic models, SQLModel (with Alembic migrations), and helpful scripts.


> Note: This project is configured to use `uv` (https://astral.sh/uv) as the recommended way to initialize and manage the project. See **README.md** for `uv init` commands and developer instructions.

### `README.md`

# true-connect

FastAPI project for user-profile CRUD with Postgres, Alembic migrations, pytest and Docker.

## Quickstart (using `uv`)

1. Install `uv` (see https://astral.sh/uv)
2. Initialize project (if you want uv-managed structure):

```bash
uv init true-connect
# or from within the project directory do nothing — we already provide pyproject.toml
```

3. Create a `.env` from `.env.example` and set DB settings.

4. Start services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

5. Create the DB and run migrations:

```bash
# inside the web container or locally with uv run
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

6. Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for API docs.
```
```


## Alembic - generating initial migration

To generate an initial migration after you've created models, run (inside your environment):

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "create profiles"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

This will populate `alembic/versions/` with a migration file.

## Notes & next steps

* This base uses `sqlmodel` for concise Pydantic + SQLAlchemy models. It supports `pydantic` validations (you asked for pedantic — I used `pydantic` via SQLModel).
* For production: use Alembic-managed migrations rather than `init_db()` table creation at startup.
* Tests here are simplified. In CI, provision an ephemeral Postgres instance or use a testcontainer.

If you want, I can now:
- generate actual Alembic `versions/` initial migration file,
- convert `pyproject.toml` to include dev dependencies (pytest, httpx, uv) for `uv`,
- or produce a downloadable zip of the project.

Tell me which you'd like and I'll add it directly into the canvas.
